A PhotoMosaic is a picture created by taking some source picture, dividing it up
into rectangular sections, and replacing each section with a small thumbnail
image whose color closely approximates the color of the section it replaces.
Viewing the photo at low magnification, the individual pixels appear as the source image, while a closer examination reveals that the image is made up of many smaller tile images.
